# Intelligent-1
It's a replica (most probably) for a program that I saw on MIT OCW in AI lectures. A Stanford Professor has already made this. I am just trying my luck. This program just relocates the Boxes from one position to another, it is intelligent in the sense that it first checks whether the relocation might require another relocation or not.
